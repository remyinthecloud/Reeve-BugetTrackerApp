# Reeve-ExpenseTrackerApp

A new Flutter project using the NOTION API with the programming language dart.

## Getting Started

This app was created using Flutter. The reason Flutter makes app development simpler is that Flutter allows you to write and compile one project that leads to two seperate apps. One for android and one for IOS. 

This way you don't have to create one app in Swift for IOS and upload that to the App store. Then one app in Java for Android and upload that to the Google Play Store. Flutter instead compiles your code to machine code for both which maded my life a lot easier.

A few resources I used for developing my first Flutter project:

- [[Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)]
- [Notion API for Developers] (https://developers.notion.com/)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


## Walkthrough for my first Flutter App: Reeve - Expense Tracker App


●	Implemented the tracking system using “NOTION API” with Postman (API testing, POST method) to query a database table of expenses from notion to the app.
●	Designed the complete UI for the welcome page and spending chart.
●	Formulated a refresh functionality when sliding the page down inside the app that updates as the database on notion does.
